A and CNAME records are standard DNS records. ALIAS and URL records are custom DNS records. 

A record maps a 'name' to one or more IP addresses when IP addresses are known and stable.
CNAME maps a 'name' to another 'name'. It should only be used when there are no records on that name.
ALIAS maps a 'name' to another 'name' as well but it can coexist with other records on that name.
