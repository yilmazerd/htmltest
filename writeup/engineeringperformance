Software engineers can achieve amazing things working alone yet for large scale projects, 
for developing, iterating launching and supporting production applications you need teams. 
Teams need to communicate, coordinate and work together. 


It becomes more difficult to work as a team when members have hard time communicating with each other.

Team Coordination Complexity
Suppose Alex is working on a task himself and his manager decides this is too much for alex to work alone 
and brings in Brenda. Now Alex needs to explain how things work to Brenda and manager needs to be involved 
at some level to ensure Alex is actually explaning things to Brenda and the process for involving Brenda is
wokring. Suppose after a while, Chris and Dianna need to also join to team. Now Manager, Alex and Brenda need 
to work with Chris and Dianna to get them up to speed while also continuoung their commitments. Now if the team continous 
to grow, the number of such communications will also increase. With the addition of project manager Thomas, organizing meetings
and ensuring communicaion documents are in place can be standardized but now the manager, 
Alex and Breanda (who now are lead engineers) need to work with Thomas and attend meetings together to up to speed the new members.
