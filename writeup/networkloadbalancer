Network Load Balancer

What is a network load balancer and why it matters

Where is the need coming from:

Suppose you are developing a web application and you have one server. Over time you are doing well and the traffic is increasing in your website. Let's say you wish to add another
resource so that you can manage the traffic. You'll need a way to manage the traffic between the existing resource and the new resource. You'll want to "balance" the "load" 
between those resources so that chance of success is high. 
Microsoft's definition for load balancing is pretty clear: 
Load balancing refers to evenly distributing load (incoming network traffic) across a group of backend resources or servers.

What is a load balancer: 

A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for the clients. And the load balancer distributes incoming requets into multiple targets. Targerts are called "listeners". 
If the client is making a significant amount of requests where the targets are running near maximum capacity, you can balance your targets by adding more.

Load balancer needs to know the backend is healthy and up:

When a load balancer receives a request, it then finds a target and attempts to make a tcp connection to this target, on the port specified for this target.
