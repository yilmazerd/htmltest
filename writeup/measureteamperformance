When measuring softwrae team performance:

Input -> Process -> Output

Focusing on one of them doesn't work. 
For instance, suppose you only measure number of lines or number of days per commit, you are still looking to the process.

#1 Are the clients happy? (Did we deliver what the client asked for on time) 
>> Do we have mechanisms in place to help the client if the system stops working

#2 Can we keep the cients happy (Is our system at a place where we can quickly and reliably add more features)?
>> For this we should take continous measures
>> What is the amount of time I need to expect between my commit to deploy to production today? What was that time last year? 
>> How long the client should wait for their request to become a product features

#3 Is the team happy?
>> Are we managing this working normal hours
>> Are we learning things?
